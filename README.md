# Test Assignment
So, after a week of work, I created this application, it includes the MVVM pattern (at least I think so), 
a field for entering code, a field for choosing a programming language.
And then the problems begin. The memory limit doesn't work because I just don't know how to do it, 
all I could do was get the amount of memory the system has allocated for this process.
The runtime limit doesn't work also, for the same reason as memory limit.
Progress display has problem but not in my side. 
It's not my first time working with the API, but when I create an object as shown in the example 
and pass this object as JSON I get a response from the server with the following text
"{\"message\": \"ArgumentMissingError: source is needed!\", \"errors\": {}}"
The object contains data, so why the error occurs i don't know. Maybe I didn't understand the instructions correctly, or I just made a mistake somwhere.
The design includes a button that changes the theme, but for some reason it does not work correctly with menu.
